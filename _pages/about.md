My research interests include computer graphics, computer vision, and computational imaging. I am working at IIS Computer Vision & Machine Learning Lab, Academia Sinica, advised by Prof. Tyng-Luh Liu. 

Before that, I worked with Prof. Yung-Yu Chuang on image denoising and semantic segmention, and Prof. Homer H. Chen on light field video synthesis.
